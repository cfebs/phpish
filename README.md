# [WIP] phpish

A php framework for people who want to read the code and not go crazy.

## Features

- [x] Router
    - `routes.php` file where you define routes
    - Request/Response pattern
- [ ] Controller/View pattern
- [ ] ORM + caching pattern
- [ ] User auth and token pattern;w

The features are about what you _need_ to perform the following tasks:

- tools to fufill http requests
- model data asuming some persistent storage
- support user tokens and sessions

The rest is completely out of the framework's hands and can be suplimented with libraries.
